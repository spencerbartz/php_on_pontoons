# php_on_pylons
An MVC / ORM framework written in PHP, loosely based on Ruby on Rails.

Do you ever wonder how libraries and frameworks work internally? Well
I sure do. I was always the type of kid who played the video game first
and read the manual later. Tearing things apart and re-inventing the wheel
is the way I learn.

Rather than trust the "magic" provided by Ruby on Rails, I thought
I would put forth a more literal explicit alternative. While there 
are sure to be exceptions, my basic mantra is "If you didn't type it,
it ain't happening!"
