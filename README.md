# php_on_pylons
An MVC framework for PHP, loosely based on Ruby on Rails.

After using Rails for over a year I started wondering how it worked internally.
There seemed to be a lot of magic happening behind the scenes and I thought it would be
fun and educational to try and create my own framework, with my own brand of magic.
Welcome to PHP on Pylons!

**Update**: Darn it, "Pylons" is already a _Python_ framework. 
TODO: Think of another witty support structure that starts with the letter P.
